"Think Python" by Allen Downey

# 1 "The way of the Program"
- Something I already knew is how the print function works.

- Something I didn't know is that Python has two versions, Python 2 and Python 3.

# 3 "Functions"
- Something I already knew is that you can use a function inside another function.

- Something I didn't know about was modules, and that there are built-in modules that you need to import to use.

# 5 "Conditionals and recursion"
- Something I already knew is how the modulus operator (%) works because we already used it in javascript.

- Something I didn't know is that elif is used as an abbreviation of "else if".

# 10 "Lists"
- Something I already knew is that lists start counting from 0.

- Something I didn't know is that you can have a nested list inside another list.
