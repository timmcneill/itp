"Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke

# Ch 1 Values, Types, and Operators
- Something I already knew from this chapter is that numbers are represented in bits. 

- Something I didn’t know that I thought was interesting was the “automatic type conversion” that Javascript does when you put in the wrong type of value for an operator. It tries to convert it to the type that it needs automatically.

# Ch 2 Program Structure
- Something I already knew about from this chapter would be comments, which are ignored by the computer and used to make the code easier to understand if a person is reading it.

- Something I didn’t know is that line breaks aren’t required and it is possible to write a whole program on a single line.

# Ch 3 Functions
- There didn't seem to really be much in this chapter that I already knew. I did know that functions are used to reduce repetition, because they let you reuse a smaller piece of a program.

- I didn't know about scopes; where there are bindings that can only be seen in the block they are declared.
